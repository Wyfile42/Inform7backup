In Part 5 - The Room where people are living:


  >--> You wrote 'Understand the command "turning on" as something new' (source
    text, line 239): but 'understand the command ... as ...' is only allowed
    when the old command is a single word, so for instance 'understand the
    command "capture" as "get"' is okay, but 'understand the command "capture
    the flag" as "get"' is not.
