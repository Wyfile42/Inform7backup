An Interactive Fiction by Emily Seifert

Bedroom (in the Bed)
The room where the human resides for most of her time during the school year. It's cozy. A galaxy themed aesthetic fills the bedsheets on the bed in which you and your fellow plushies lay on top of. The human is gone until 3pm, including her roommates. 

The way to leave the room is to the north. It's time to explore.

On the Desk is Laptop.

In the Bed you can see Pillows (on which is Plushies) and Rabbit.

They range from two tiny foxes, a white dog with a red target for an eye, and 4 bunnies of different shapes and sizes. The thin brown and grey rabbit sitting in front of the first pillow seems the most reasonable to talk to.

        <result xml:space="preserve">You hoist your body onto the seat and get on the chair. You reposition yourself so you're facing the desk.

Bedroom (on Chair)
The room where the human resides for most of her time during the school year. 

The way to leave the room is to the north. It's time to explore.

On the Desk is Laptop.

        <result xml:space="preserve">You open up the laptop and turn it on. It is just a bit slow like the human says it is, but it's still perfectly functional.
