What Rocky Does When No One's Around
An Interactive Fiction by Emily Seifert
Release 1 / Serial number 250930 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Bedroom (in the Bed)
The room where the human resides for most of her time during the school year. It's cozy. A galaxy themed aesthetic fills the bedsheets on the bed in which you and your fellow plushies lay on top of. The human is gone until 3pm, including her roommates. 

The way to leave the room is to the north. It's time to explore.

On the Desk is Laptop.

In the Bed you can see Pillows (on which is Plushies) and Rabbit.

 Yup, its a hallway. There's a beam in the middle of the space. Someone could run into that!  You can go west to the area of Skull Kid's room or east to where the living room and Monster Kid's room are.

 You politely ask the rabbit for him and the others plushies to leave the pillows so you can use them.
